        <h1>Money: The Charles Hurwitz story</h1>
        <p id="author"> by Bill Meyers published originally in Coast Magazine</p>

        <p>Charles E. Hurwitz was born 1940 in Kilgore, Texas to Hyman and Eva Hurwitz. His father owned two clothing
            stores and
            built the small town's first shopping center. Charles graduated in 1962, with a degree in marketing, from
            Oklahoma
            University. 
            He served in the U.S. Army from 1962 to 1964. Then he became a stockbroker for Bache in San
            Antonio.</p>

        <p>In 1988 the company led by Charles Hurwitz, Maxxam, bought controlling interest in Kaiser Aluminum, one of
            the
            world's largest companies. This brought Maxxam into the top 200 largest American corporations, according to
            Fortune's listings. Yet few people know that Charles Hurwitz controls Kaiser. Instead it is his ownership of
            Pacific
            Lumber, a northern California timber producer captured by Maxxam in 1986, that has most consistently put Mr.
            Hurwitz
            in the newspaper headlines.</p>

        <p>To understand how a member of a small-time business family could, in 24 years, become one of America's most
            prominent
            industrialists, you need to understand three business techniques not well understood by the public. One is
            what I
            call the bankruptcy shuffle, in which funds are transferred out of a corporation, leaving it bankrupt. That
            technique is also referred to as the OPM, or other people's money method of gaining wealth. The
            second
            is the minority shareholder squeeze, in which the value of the investments by minority shareholders are
            captured by
            the party controlling the corporation. The third is Greenmail.</p>

        <p>Using the bankruptcy laws to transfer (the victims would call it steal) wealth is an American
            shady
            business tradition. Under the law one of the most basic features of corporations in the U.S. is that neither
            management nor shareholders are responsible for the corporation's debts if it becomes bankrupt. There are
            many
            variations on this technique. I will use a very simple, straightforward example. You have three
            corporations, A, B,
            and C. Corporation A is legitimate, let's say it makes dresses. Corporations B and C are controlled by the
            same
            person, whose sole desire is to rip-off Corporation A. Corporation B is set up as a retail clothing store.
            Corporation C consults for retail clothing stores. Corporation B buys $1,000,000 of dresses from Corporation
            A on
            credit. It then sells the dresses for $1,000,000 and has one expense itself, a $1,000,000 consulting fee to
            Corporation C. Corporation B then has a debt and no assets, so it declares bankruptcy. Corporation B's
            stockholders
            and management say they aren't responsible, they are protected by lawyers and the bankruptcy laws. Usually
            Corporation C pays out the $1,000,000 to its shareholders, who put the money in secret offshore accounts,
            and
            declares bankruptcy itself.</p>

        <p>Want to do a shareholder squeeze? Suppose you own some stock in a small corporation that is making $5,000,000
            a year
            in profits and is paying a dividend of $1 per share out of it. You could by enough stock to control the
            corporation
            and appoint yourself CEO and pay yourself $5,000,000 per year, leaving no profits and dropping the dividend.
            The
            stock of the other shareholders, for practical purposes, now has a value of 0. There are many other ways to
            milka corporation besides excessive executive compensation, most notably transfer of funds to a
            holding
            company; both these techniques were used by Charles Hurwitz during his long career.</p>

        <p>Greenmail involves targeting a (usually) legitimate business and buying a portion of its stock. You then
            declare
            (because the SEC requires you to) that you are going to buy more stock and take it over. The current
            management and
            stockholders know that if you gain control they will suffer from the Minority Squeeze, or maybe they just
            don't like
            you, or like being in control themselves. So they make a deal to buy your stock from you at a higher price
            than your
            original purchase price. You've turned a form of blackmail into green money.</p>

        <p>To successful carry off these kinds of business dealings it helps to have a variety of corporate shells.
            These
            corporations allow an individual or group of businesspeople to move money around in ways that make it
            difficult for
            those who feel victimized to successful sue and recover their money. They may also have legitimate business
            purposes; shell corporations are not in themselves illegal. It should be noted that the following account,
            while
            following the essence of Charles Hurwitz's business dealings, has vastly oversimplified the tangled web of
            corporations (many with similar names) that he controlled, invested in, or managed.</p>

        <p>The First $10 Million is the hardest</p>

        <p></p>

        <p>In 1965, after only a year as a stockbroker for Bache, Charles Hurwitz formed Investamerica with his
            brother-in-law
            Morris Penner; the firm was capitalized by the Hurwitz and Penner families. Investamerica sold mutual funds
            and did
            very well in 1965-67 bull market. By all accounts Mr. Hurwitz was a very impressive sales person. He
            attracted the
            attention of a number of wealthy Texans and in 1967 started Hedge Fund of America (with the other wealthy
            men) with
            a public offering worth $54 million in 1967.</p>

        <p>In a pattern that is not particularly unusual in business, and would characterize Charles Hurwitz's business
            arrangements for the rest of his career, a set of shell corporations was created. Shell corporations own or
            are
            owned by other companies, but conduct no business of their own. Hurwitz left Investamerica to run Summit
            Management
            &amp; Research Corporation, which owned Hedge Fund of America and was controlled in turn by SMR Holding
            Company.
            Also note that a complex, ever changing group of individuals worked with Mr. Hurwitz; here I will refer to
            them
            simply as the Hurwitz group.</p>

        <p>The market collapse and bear market in 1969 killed Investamerica and Hedge Fund of America. SMR Holding
            bought the
            unrelated Summit Group, Inc., a New York holding company in the high-risk auto insurance business, the main
            asset
            being Summit Insurance Company of New York. (Note that while the value of Hurwitz's holdings collapsed, so
            did the
            value of most stocks, so it was possible to buy companies very cheaply at that time.) In 1970 the Securities
            and
            Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Hurwitz with securities fraud for his role in Summit Group, Inc. Yet
            Summit was
            taken public (its shares began being sold on a stock exchange) with Hurwitz as chairman. To do this Mr.
            Hurwitz
            signed a consent decree saying he would engage in no future violations of securities laws.</p>

        <p>By 1975 Summit Insurance Company of New York was in bankruptcy proceedings, and shortly after Summit Group,
            Inc. was
            also declared bankrupt and closed down by the State of New York. Charles Hurwitz was charged with insurance
            fraud
            for illegally transferring funds between his corporations. Hurwitz settled the case for $400,000 in 1979.
        </p>

        <p>At this point the reader might ask how, with so many corporation bankruptcies in his wake, Charles Hurwitz
            managed to
            continue to buy new companies. This is where the bankruptcy shuffle, or Other People's Money (OPM) technique
            came
            in. To make a long story short, enough money had been taken out of the businesses by Charles Hurwitz and his
            group
            to buy or set up other companies.</p>


        <h2>Federated Development Corporation</h2>


        <p>One of the outside stockholders in Summit Insurance Company of New York was Federated Development
            Corporation, a Real
            Estate Investment Trust (REIT). Hurwitz's group successfully took over Federated in 1973 using, in part,
            $12.5
            million they borrowed from Continental Illinois and other banks. Hurwitz became CEO of Federated. The
            Hurwitz group
            then created a transaction in which Federated (which they controlled and mostly owned) bought SMR Holding
            (which
            they owned) and assumed SMR's debt, which included the very loans used to buy Federated in the first place!
            Then SMR
            defaulted on the loans, and after negotiations paid 53 cents on the dollar to the lending banks. SMR
            dissolved and,
            for a while, Federated was the Hurwitz's main business vehicle. There are few better examples of a
            successful
            bankruptcy shuffle than this.</p>

        <p>Federated had stockholders other than the Hurwitz group. In 1979, Hurwitz engineered a reverse, 1 for 40,
            stock split
            that drove out many small investors, so that there were less than 300 shareholders left in Federated. This
            was
            largely in order to avoid filing public disclosures with the SEC, but it also an example of the Minority
            Squeeze
            technique frequently used by Mr. Hurwitz. I'll note here that this story is only an outline of Charles
            Hurwitz's
            career. It can't possibly describe all his transactions, or use of the minority squeeze, or even any one
            transaction
            in full detail. But is should be said that there have been several lawsuits against Mr. Hurwitz involving
            this
            issue.</p>

        <p>Federated Development Corporation had one legitimate business interest: real estate management. But its real
            money
            would come from corporate takeovers and the practice known as Greenmail.</p>

        <p>Through an extremely complicated series of transactions, some legitimate investments in undervalued companies
            and
            some Greenmail campaigns, many masterminded by the infamous leveraged buyout and junk bond specialists
            Drexel,
            Burnham, Lambert (led by Michael Milken) and many involving junk bonds, Hurwitz would build up his net worth
            and
            that of Federated during the 1970's and 1980's.</p>

        <p>One critical step was Charles Hurwitz's hostile takeover was of McCulloch Oil Corporation, which was a large
            corporation focused on oil exploration and extraction. but which suffered a $60 million loss in 1976. In
            1978
            Federated bought an option to buy 1 million shares at $3.50 a share and 1,216,931 shares at $10 per share.
            In 1980
            the takeover was completed and the company was re-christened MCO Holdings. By stock manipulations Hurwitz
            increased
            his voting control. Federated had 47% of the voting power at MCO.</p>

        <p>In 1981 Charles Hurwitz first teamed up with Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Drexel issued junk
            bonds for
            MCO Holdings. Junk bonds carry a high interest rate because they are risky investments backed by uncertain
            revenue
            streams. The proceeds are almost always used to takeover other companies. Mr. Hurwitz also tried to force
            out
            minority shareholders in Federated Development Company at a loss through a 1 for 600 stock reverse split,
            but was
            blocked by lawsuits.</p>

        <p>In 1982 Mr. Hurwitz and MCO Holdings took over Simplicity Pattern Company, Inc. Yes, the company that makes
            the
            patterns that homemakers buy to make clothing at home. The first stake, 33%, was bought using a $100 million
            loan
            from 1st Interstate Bank of California. This gave Charles control of a second major company engaged in
            legitimate
            business. He and his friends owned or controlled numerous smaller corporations at that time.</p>

        <p>Using Simplicity Pattern Company, Inc., MCO Holdings, and United Financial Corp, Hurwitz continued the
            greenmail
            game. Victims included Holly Sugar, Amstar, and Castle &amp; Cook. It should be noted that in the Castle
            &amp; Cook
            case savings and loans deposits were used, and a federal court issued an injunction, but the greenmail went
            forward
            and succeeded after Hurwitz amended the Federal Trade Commission filings.</p>


        <h2>Maxxam Created</h2>


        <p>Maxxam Group Inc. was created from Simplicity Pattern Corp in June 1984 in a complex multi-company deal. The
            deal was
            financed with Drexel junk bonds. Maxxam was a shell corporation to be used to invest in or control other
            corporations. In effect MCO Holdings was absorbed into Maxxam.</p>

        <p>Drexel targeted Pacific Lumber as a potential takeover target in 1984, and talked to Maxxam as well as other
            corporate raiders about it, but nothing came of it. By the spring of 1985 Hurwitz changed his mind and
            decided to
            pursue Pacific Lumber.</p>


        <h2>The Savings and Loans Takeovers</h2>


        <p>Ronald Reagan had been elected in 1980, and the savings and loan industry was deregulated in October 1982, so
            it is
            not surprising Hurwitz went on a savings &amp; loan buying spree at that time. In 1983 Federated and MCO
            Holdings
            gained control of United Financial Group (UFG) which in turn controlled United Savings Association of Texas
            (USAT),
            a group of small Savings &amp; Loans, which then absorbed another savings and loan, Houston First American.
            Drexel
            also became a stockholder of United Financial Group.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile Hurwitz's Savings &amp; Loan operation was involved in buying and selling banks and other
            companies. It
            should be noted that Drexel Burnham Lambert required quite a bit in return for its help in financing deals.
            Drexel
            bought 7% of the UFG/USAT common stock. But USAT bought $5 million in Drexel bonds and increased its stake
            in Drexel
            mortgage backed securities from $250 million in 1984 to $6.5 billion in 1986. In effect USAT was converting
            savings
            deposits to junk bonds so that Drexel could finance corporate takeovers. USAT sold about half its branches
            to IASA
            in 1984, for its only profitable year. The normal profits from savings &amp; loan operations were being
            drowned in a
            sea of red ink by the use of funds to acquire other companies.</p>

        <p>Drexel created a blind pool of $150 million in junk bonds for Maxxam in May of 1985.</p>

        <p>Maxxam was involved in buying and speculating in numerous companies that were targeted for takeover by Drexel
            allies,
            notably TSG (Maxxam kept 12% ownership), Revlon, and General Foods.</p>

        <p>On September 23, 1985, TSG bought 15,000 shares of Pacific Lumber.</p>


        <h2>Savings &amp; Loan Bankruptcy</h2>


        <p>The Office of Thrift Supervision [OTS] of the Department of the Treasury in the Matter of United Savings
            Association
            of Texas and United Financial Group, Inc., has formally charged Maxxam, Inc., Federated Development Co.,
            Charles E.
            Hurwitz, and Barry A. Munitz, Jenard M. Gross, Arthur S. Berner, Ronald Huebsch, and Michael Crow (Present
            and
            Former Directors and/or officers of the above named institutions) with a variety of violations of the law,
            which on
            the whole amount to enriching themselves with savings and loans assets and then leaving the savings &amp;
            loans with
            huge debts that were paid off with Federal Deposit Insurance funds. The following quotations are from the
            Notice of
            Charges in the case. It should be noted that the Hurwitz group denies the charges (though not necessarily
            the facts
            they are based on) and are vigorously opposing the government in court.</p>

        <p>In 1982, MCO and Federated, assisted by Drexel, began to acquire shares of UFG, the holding company of
            USAT,
            with the intention of obtaining control of UFG and USAT. By June 1983, MCO, Federated, Hurwitz and
            Kozmetsky, acting
            in concert, had purchased nearly 25% of the shares of UFG, and on June 29, 1983 filed an Application H (e)
            -1 with
            the FHLBB</p>

        <p>for approval to obtain control of UFG through the proposed purchase of an additional 10% of UFG's
            shares.</p>

        <p>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board [FHLBB] in December 1984 approved the Hurwitz group's buying of up to 35% of
            UFG
            shares, provided they infuse capital sufficient to maintain USAT's net worth at levels required by the
            regulations.
            Drexel also obtained shares of UFG and sold MCO a call option on them. By 1986 the Hurwitz group had
            transformed
            USAT from a traditional savings and loan association into a vehicle for speculative, highly-leveraged,
            high-risk investments... in low grade corporate bonds (junk bonds) and in mortgage-backed
            securities
            (MBS's) and their derivatives.</p>

        <p>Between 1984 and 1988, USAT purchased over $1.5 billion of Drexel junk bonds and other Drexel-brokered
            securities. Because Drexel had acted in concert with MCO, Federated, and Hurwitz to obtain control of UFG
            and USAT,
            the purchases of these securities from Drexel were prohibited affiliated person transactions in violation of
            applicable regulations.</p>

        <p>28. In order to maintain the appearance of substantial net worth (when, in fact, USAT's net worth
            failed to
            meet the minimum regulatory requirements), avoid contributing capital to USAT to maintain its net worth
            pursuant to
            the FHLBB condition, stave off regulatory intervention, and maintain USAT as a purchaser and trader of
            Drexel-underwritten junk bonds, the Respondents engaged in unsafe and unsound practices and violations of
            numerous
            regulations, which are the subject of this Notice of Charges.</p>

        <p>[They] utilized the proceeds to speculate in mortgage-backed securities in a manner that increased the
            risk of
            loss to USAT dramatically. In order to conceal the additional risks to USAT, the Respondents made
            misrepresentations
            to the federal regulators that USAT's portfolio of MBS's was a fully-hedged investment portfolio, rather
            than a
            speculative trading portfolio.</p>

        <p>30. In addition, the Respondents caused USAT to engage in unsafe and unsound lending practices and real
            estate
            investments.</p>

        <p>31. Finally, when it became apparent that they could no longer conceal that USAT failed its minimum
            capital
            requirements, the Respondents caused UFG and USAT to enter into employment agreements with exorbitant,
            illegal,
            unsafe and unsound severance provisions for the benefit of certain of the Individual Respondents. After USAT
            was
            found to be insolvent and placed in receivership, Respondents caused UFG to fund the payment of benefits
            under the
            severance provisions, and Respondents Munitz, Berner, Crow, and Gross were unjustly enriched by their
            receipt of
            such payments.</p>

        <p>32. In November 1988, less than five years after Drexel, Hurwitz, Federated, MCO, and Kozmetsky gained
            control
            of UFG and USAT, USAT was required to execute a supervisory agreement with FSLIC. On December 30, 1988, USAT
            was
            placed in receivership, with FSLIC acting as receivers Immediately thereafter, USAT's deposit liabilities
            were
            assumed by, and</p>

        <p>substantially all of its assets were transferred to, a new federally chartered savings bank. The loss to the
            insurance fund exceeded $1.6 billion, of which more than $200 million is attributable to the MBS
            transactions and
            more than $50 million to the real estate loans that are the subject of this Notice of Charges.</p>

        <p>33. Hurwitz, MAXXAM (as successor to MCO), Federated, and UFG contributed no assets to maintain the net
            worth
            of USAT in accordance with their obligations under the resolutions issued by the FHLBB.</p>


        <h2>The Pacific Lumber takeover</h2>

        <p></p>

        <p>So on December 30, 1988, a major Hurwitz group asset was taken over by the federal government, which would
            cost
            taxpayers $1.6 Billion dollars. But Pacific Lumber had been acquired by Maxxam in 1986, using junk bonds
            floated by
            Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert. These junk bonds obligated Maxxam to pay enormous amounts of
            interest to
            the holders. It was in 1988 that Maxxam captured a far larger prize, Kaiser Aluminum, one of America's
            largest
            corporations.</p>

        <p>Compared to some of Charles Hurwitz's other deals, the takeover of Pacific Lumber was relatively
            straightforward.
            Pacific Lumber's stock did not reflect the real value of its assets, largely because the company was
            harvesting its
            timberlands at a conservative rate compared to other timber companies. Drexel had been unable to interest
            other
            buyers in Pacific Lumber largely because of environmental issues: it was clear to everyone, in advance, that
            in
            order to buy Pacific Lumber with junk bonds, the plan would have to include not just a higher rate of
            logging, but
            rapid destruction of rare old-growth redwood forests.</p>

        <p>Pacific Lumber also had $65 million in a pension plan for its employees. After the takeover Maxxam used this
            cash for
            its own purposes.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the Securities and Exchange Commission, in September 1988, charged that Drexel forced its
            client,
            Maxxam, to pay an inflated price for Pacific Lumber Company. As outlined in the SEC lawsuit, on September
            30, 1985,
            Maxxam made a tender offer for Pacific Lumber at $36 a share, and the same day demanded and received a 50%
            cut in
            Drexel's fee. Then Ivan Boesky started to buy stock for Michael Milken at Drexel, without Maxxam's
            knowledge,
            pushing the open market price of Pacific Lumber above the offer price. Maxxam raised its tender offer to
            $38.50 a
            share. On October 22 Maxxam increased its offer to $40 per share and Pacific Lumber capitulated. Drexel's
            fees
            exceeded $22 million. In other words, Drexel/Milken stabbed their buddy, Charles Hurwitz, in the back.
            Unless he was
            secretly in on the deception.</p>

        <p>Several other lawsuits attended the Pacific Lumber takeover, including one by the heirs of the family that
            had
            controlled Pacific Lumber, and one over the raid on the pension fund.</p>

        <p>In 1993, Pacific Lumber used $235 million in its own junk bonds (with a yield of 10.5%) and $385 million of
            Timber Notes issued by Scotia Pacific to acquire ownership of Scotia Pacific</p>

        <p>Pacific Lumber's financial outlook is heavily dependent on the outcome of a variety of lawsuits and
            regulatory
            proposals and the proposed deal for the California and Federal government to acquire a small part of the
            Headwaters
            forest area of Pacific Lumber's timber holdings. This excludes earlier lawsuits from the actual takeover of
            Pacific
            Lumber, which netted settlements of about $150 million, of which Maxxam paid $52 million. According to
            Pacific
            Lumber's SEC filing 10-K405 of 3/26/98, the long list of laws that must be complied with have not had
            a
            significant adverse affect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. However, these
            laws and
            related administrative actions and legal challenges have severely restricted the ability of Pacific Lumber
            to
            harvest virgin old growth timber. Pacific Lumber claims that these timberlands have been
            taken by
            California and the U.S. and Pacific Lumber should receive just compensation.</p>

        <p>According to the same filing, Pacific Lumber and Maxxam entered into an agreement with the US and California
            which
            provides a framework for the acquisition of approximately 5,600 acres of Pacific Lumber's
            timberlands
            known as the Headwaters Forest. These would be traded for property with a fair market value of $300 million
            and
            approximately 7,755 acres of adjacent timberlands (the Elk River Timberlands) to be
            acquired from
            a third party. This will be dependent on the approval of a Sustained Yield Plan (SYP) for all of
            Pacific
            Lumber's remaining timberlands. Pacific Lumber looks forward to the approval of the SYP because While
            the
            Company expects these environmentally focused lawsuits to continue, it believes that the HCP/SYP Agreement
            will
            enhance its position in connection with these challenges... [and] expedite the preparation and facilitate
            the
            approval of its THP's.</p>

        <p>Maxxam also gained control of Kaiser, the aluminum company, in 1988. From a financial point of view this was
            a far
            greater achievement than buying Pacific Lumber. In 1998 Maxxam held 35.4% of Kaiser shares. Income from
            Kaiser
            represents about 75% of Maxxam's income. Maxxam now has created one race track, Sam Houston Race Park, and
            bought
            another, Mexico City's Hipodromo de las Americas.</p>

        <p>In 1997 Maxxam reported a net income of $65.2 million, or $2.42 per share. Net sales for 1997 were $2.7
            billion.
            Aluminum operations (Kaiser) created operating income of $174 million for 1997. Forest products Operating
            income
            (Pacific Lumber) was $84.9 million. Real estate and other operations lost $5 million. Interest received was
            $50
            million. Interest expense ($211 million) on junk bonds is the main reason the net income of Maxxam is far
            lower than
            the total income of its three types of operations. On April 3, 1998 Maxxam shares, traded on the American
            Stock
            Exchange, closed at $60 per share. In 1994 Texas Monthly Magazine reported Charles Hurwitz's personal wealth
            to be
            estimated at $140 million.</p>
